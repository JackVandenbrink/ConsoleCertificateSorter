# Console Certificate Sorter
 A console application to automatically sort certificates into sub folders.
 ## The benefit.
 Downloading certificates and sorting them takes a fair amount of time and
 there is lots of room for human error. I also wanted to make this because I thought
 it would be a fun project to work on.
